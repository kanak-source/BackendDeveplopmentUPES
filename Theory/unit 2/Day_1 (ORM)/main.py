# --- Models with back_populates ---
# 'back_populates' creates a bidirectional relationship. 
# It links the 'Student' object to the 'Department' object and vice-versa.
# For example, if you have a 'Student' object, you can access their 'department' 
# object directly (student.department). Conversely, if you have a 'Department' 
# object, you can access all 'students' belonging to that department 
# (department.students). SQLAlchemy manages the synchronization automatically 
# when you update either side of the relationship.
